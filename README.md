# Encrypt
It might be an encrypt program. Probably.
  From my first "Hello World" I wanted to write my own encrypt program.
So, here I am)

Use 'g++ main.cpp encrypt.cpp decrypt.cpp -o Enc' to compile this programm with gcc compiler

or

Run GenerateProject.bat file to generate .sln file and all necessary files for MS VS.
